# End-to-End Encryption Guide

## 🔐 Overview

CogniNote implements **client-side end-to-end encryption** (E2EE) to ensure maximum privacy and security for your notes. When encryption is enabled, all your note content is encrypted on your device before being synced to the cloud, and only you can decrypt it.

### Key Components

1. **Password-Based Encryption**
   - You choose a strong encryption password
   - Key is derived using PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
   - Salt is randomly generated and stored (public, safe)

2. **AES-256-GCM Encryption**
   - Military-grade encryption algorithm
   - Each note encrypted with unique IV (initialization vector)
   - Authenticated encryption prevents tampering

3. **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**
   - Your encryption key never leaves your device
   - We cannot decrypt your notes
   - You are the only one with access

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Enabling Encryption

1. **After Signup**
   - You'll be prompted to enable encryption
   - Or enable it later in Settings → Encryption

2. **Create Encryption Password**
   - Choose a strong, memorable password
   - This is separate from your login password
   - Must be at least 8 characters

3. **Save Recovery Key**
   - **CRITICAL:** Save this 64-character recovery key
   - Store it in a password manager or secure location
   - Without it, you cannot recover notes if you forget your password

### Using Encrypted Notes

1. **Unlock Encryption**
   - After logging in, enter your encryption password
   - Your notes will be decrypted and available

2. **Lock Encryption**
   - Go to Settings → Encryption → Lock Encryption
   - Notes become inaccessible until you unlock again
   - Useful when stepping away from your device

3. **Auto-Lock** (Future Feature)
   - Option to automatically lock after inactivity
   - Configurable timeout period

## 🔑 Technical Details

### Encryption Specifications

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Algorithm | AES-256-GCM |
| Key Derivation | PBKDF2 |
| Iterations | 100,000 |
| Salt Length | 16 bytes (128 bits) |
| IV Length | 12 bytes (96 bits) |
| Key Length | 32 bytes (256 bits) |

### What Gets Encrypted

✅ **Encrypted:**
- Note content (text, formatting, embedded data)
- Diagram data (flowcharts, mindmaps, etc.)
- AI API keys (double-encrypted)

❌ **NOT Encrypted (Metadata):**
- Note titles (for search/navigation)
- Note IDs
- Creation/modification dates
- Note type (document, flowchart, etc.)
- Hierarchy/folder structure

> **Why?** Metadata encryption would break search, navigation, and real-time sync features. Titles are kept in plaintext for usability. If you need title privacy, use generic names.

### Storage

```typescript
// Firestore Document Structure
{
  id: "note-123",
  title: "My Note",              // Plaintext
  encrypted: true,                // Flag
  content: {
    encrypted: true,
    data: "8fj3k2l..."           // Base64 encrypted content
  },
  iv: "jf8d9s..."                // Base64 IV for decryption
  // ... other metadata
}
```

## 🔓 Password Recovery

### If You Forget Your Password

1. **Use Recovery Key**
   - Go to Login → Forgot Encryption Password
   - Enter your 64-character recovery key
   - Set a new encryption password

2. **Without Recovery Key**
   - **Notes are PERMANENTLY UNRECOVERABLE**
   - This is by design - zero-knowledge encryption
   - You'll need to start fresh with new notes

### Best Practices

- 💾 Store recovery key in a password manager (1Password, Bitwarden, etc.)
- 📝 Print recovery key and store in a safe place
- 🔄 Keep multiple backup copies in different locations
- ⚠️ Never share your encryption password or recovery key

---

## 🛠️ Migration & Setup

### Encrypting Existing Notes

If you enable encryption after creating notes:

1. Go to **Settings → Encryption**
2. Click **Encrypt All Existing Notes**
3. All plaintext notes will be encrypted
4. This cannot be undone

### Disabling Encryption (Future Feature)

Currently, encryption cannot be disabled once enabled. This is for security. Future versions may allow:
- Decrypting all notes back to plaintext
- Exporting decrypted backup
- Re-encryption with new password

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Strengths

✅ **Military-grade encryption** (AES-256)
✅ **Client-side only** - server never sees plaintext
✅ **Zero-knowledge** - even admins can't decrypt
✅ **Unique IVs** - each note encrypted independently
✅ **Key derivation** - password stretched with PBKDF2
✅ **Authenticated encryption** - tamper-proof

### Limitations

⚠️ **Titles are plaintext** - for search/navigation
⚠️ **Metadata visible** - dates, structure, note type
⚠️ **Memory storage** - key in RAM while unlocked
⚠️ **No password reset** - by design (zero-knowledge)
⚠️ **Trust in Web Crypto API** - browser implementation

### Threat Model

**Protected Against:**
- ✅ Server breach (encrypted data useless)
- ✅ Database leak (no plaintext)
- ✅ Man-in-the-middle (encrypted in transit + at rest)
- ✅ Malicious admins (zero-knowledge)

**NOT Protected Against:**
- ❌ Keyloggers on your device
- ❌ Compromised browser/OS
- ❌ Physical access to unlocked device
- ❌ Malware with memory access
- ❌ Weak password (use strong passwords!)

## 🧪 Advanced Usage

### For Developers

#### Encrypt Data Manually

```typescript
import { encryptJSON, deriveKey } from '@/lib/crypto/encryption';

// Derive key from password
const salt = generateSalt();
const key = await deriveKey('myPassword', salt);

// Encrypt data
const data = { message: 'Secret note' };
const { ciphertext, iv } = await encryptJSON(data, key);

// Store ciphertext and iv
```

#### Decrypt Data

```typescript
import { decryptJSON } from '@/lib/crypto/encryption';

// Retrieve stored data
const decrypted = await decryptJSON(ciphertext, iv, key);
console.log(decrypted); // { message: 'Secret note' }
```

### API Integration

When using AI features with encryption enabled:
1. API keys are double-encrypted in Firestore
2. Notes are decrypted before sending to AI
3. AI responses are encrypted before storage
4. **Important:** AI providers see decrypted content

## 📊 Performance Impact

### Overhead

| Operation | Without E2EE | With E2EE | Overhead |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Create Note | ~50ms | ~150ms | +100ms |
| Load Note | ~100ms | ~250ms | +150ms |
| Save Note | ~75ms | ~200ms | +125ms |
| Search | ~20ms | ~20ms | 0ms* |

*Search is on titles (plaintext), so no overhead

### Optimization Tips

- Keep encryption unlocked during active sessions
- Lock only when stepping away
- Use strong but memorable passwords
- Enable auto-lock for security balance

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Incorrect password"**
- Check Caps Lock
- Try recovery key if forgotten
- Contact support only if you have your recovery key

**"Failed to decrypt note"**
- Ensure encryption is unlocked
- Check for browser compatibility
- Try refreshing the page
- Clear browser cache and re-login

**"Encryption key required"**
- You need to unlock encryption first
- Enter your encryption password
- Or lock/unlock from Settings

**Performance issues**
- Too many notes decrypting at once
- Close unused note tabs
- Use search instead of browsing all notes

---
