## üîß Implementation Details

### Graph View Architecture

**Libraries Used:**
- `react-force-graph-2d`: Interactive force-directed graph
- Custom graph builder
- D3-based layout algorithm

**Data Structure:**
```typescript
interface GraphNode {
  id: string;
  label: string;
  type: 'document' | 'meeting_notes' | ...;
  size: number; // Based on connections
  connections: number;
  color: string;
  emoji?: string;
}

interface GraphEdge {
  id: string;
  source: string; // Note ID
  target: string; // Note ID
  type: 'link' | 'parent-child' | 'backlink';
  weight: number;
}
```

**Graph Building:**
```typescript
import { buildGraphFromNotes } from '@/lib/graph/graph-builder';

const graph = buildGraphFromNotes(notes);
// Returns: { nodes: GraphNode[], edges: GraphEdge[] }
```

**Filtering:**
```typescript
import { filterGraph, getSubgraph } from '@/lib/graph/graph-builder';

// Search filter
const filtered = filterGraph(graph, 'project');

// Focus on specific note
const subgraph = getSubgraph(graph, noteId, depth);
```

### Collaboration Architecture

**Presence Tracking:**
```typescript
import { PresenceManager } from '@/lib/collaboration/presence';

const presence = new PresenceManager(
  noteId,
  userId,
  userName,
  userEmail,
  photoURL
);

presence.start(isEditing);
// Updates every 10 seconds
presence.stop();
// Removes presence
```

**Real-time Sync:**
```typescript
import { CollaborativeEditor } from '@/lib/collaboration/realtime-sync';

const collab = new CollaborativeEditor(noteId, userId, userName);
collab.setEditor(tiptapEditor);
collab.startCollaboration();
// Syncs changes and listens for updates
collab.stopCollaboration();
// Saves final changes
```

**Components:**
- `ActiveUsers`: Shows avatars of viewing users
- `CollaborativeCursors`: Shows other users' cursors (placeholder)

## üì± Usage Examples

### Graph View

**Basic Usage:**
```tsx
import GraphView from '@/components/graph/GraphView';

<GraphView 
  notes={notes} 
  currentNoteId={currentNoteId} 
/>
```

**With Search:**
1. Open Graph View
2. Type in search box
3. Graph filters to matching notes
4. Click node to navigate

**Focus Mode:**
1. Open a note
2. Navigate to Graph View
3. Click "Focus Mode"
4. See only connected notes (2 degrees of separation)

### Collaboration

**Enable on Note:**
```tsx
import ActiveUsers from '@/components/collaboration/ActiveUsers';
import { PresenceManager } from '@/lib/collaboration/presence';

// In note component
const presence = new PresenceManager(noteId, ...);
presence.start(true); // true = editing

<ActiveUsers noteId={noteId} />
```

**Share Link:**
```
https://your-app.com/note/NOTE_ID
```

Send this link to collaborators and they'll see live updates!

## üé® Customization

### Graph Appearance

**Node Colors:**
Edit in `lib/graph/graph-builder.ts`:
```typescript
function getNodeColor(type: string): string {
  const colors = {
    document: '#3b82f6',      // blue
    meeting_notes: '#8b5cf6', // purple
    // Add your colors here
  };
  return colors[type] || '#6b7280';
}
```

**Node Size:**
```typescript
function calculateNodeSize(note: Note, connections: number): number {
  const baseSize = 10;
  const connectionBonus = connections * 2;
  return Math.min(baseSize + connectionBonus, 50);
}
```

### User Colors

Edit in `lib/collaboration/presence.ts`:
```typescript
export function getUserColor(userId: string): string {
  const colors = [
    '#ef4444', // red

## ‚ùì FAQs

### Graph View

**Q: Can I see connections across all my notes?**
A: Yes! Graph View shows all notes and their connections.

**Q: What does node size mean?**
A: Larger nodes have more content or more connections.

**Q: Can I export the graph?**
A: Not yet, but this is planned for a future update.

**Q: Does the graph update in real-time?**
A: Yes, when you add links or create notes, the graph updates automatically.

### Collaboration

**Q: How many people can edit at once?**
A: Technically unlimited, but we recommend < 10 for best performance.

**Q: What happens if we edit the same text?**
A: Last write wins. The most recent save overwrites previous changes.

**Q: Can I see other users' cursors?**
A: This is a placeholder feature - full cursor sync coming soon!

**Q: Does it work offline?**
A: Presence requires connection. Offline edits sync when you reconnect.

**Q: Can I disable collaboration?**
A: It's always on, but only users with access to the note can see presence.
