## üñêÔ∏è Biometric Unlock

### What is it?
Biometric unlock allows you to use your device's built-in fingerprint scanner or face recognition (Face ID/Touch ID) to unlock your encrypted notes quickly and securely.

### How it Works

1. **One-Time Setup**
   - Enable encryption first (if not already enabled)
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Encryption
   - Click "Enable Biometric Unlock"
   - Authenticate with your biometric (fingerprint/face)
   - Your encryption key is securely stored on your device

2. **Unlocking**
   - When you log in, you'll see a biometric unlock option
   - Touch the fingerprint sensor or look at the camera
   - Instantly unlock your encrypted notes
   - No need to type your password!

3. **Fallback to Password**
   - Your password still works as a backup
   - Use it on devices without biometric
   - Use it if biometric fails

### Security

- **Device-Specific**: Biometric unlock is set up per device
- **Secure Storage**: Encryption key encrypted with device-specific key in IndexedDB
- **Zero-Knowledge**: Your biometric data never leaves your device
- **WebAuthn Standard**: Uses W3C Web Authentication API (WebAuthn)
- **Platform Authenticator**: Only works with built-in biometric sensors

### Supported Devices

‚úÖ **Desktop**
- MacBook with Touch ID
- Windows laptops with fingerprint sensors
- Windows Hello (face recognition)

‚úÖ **Mobile**
- iOS devices with Touch ID or Face ID
- Android devices with fingerprint sensors
- Android devices with face unlock

‚úÖ **Browsers**
- Chrome/Edge 67+
- Safari 14+
- Firefox 60+

### Setup Instructions

1. **Enable Encryption** (if not already enabled)
   ```
   Settings ‚Üí Encryption ‚Üí Enable End-to-End Encryption
   ```

2. **Set Up Biometric**
   ```
   Settings ‚Üí Encryption ‚Üí Enable Biometric Unlock
   ```

3. **Authenticate**
   - Your browser will prompt for biometric authentication
   - Touch fingerprint sensor or look at camera
   - Your encryption key is now accessible via biometric

4. **Test It**
   - Log out and log back in
   - Click "Unlock with Fingerprint/Face ID"
   - Authenticate with your biometric

### Disable Biometric

To remove biometric unlock:
```
Settings ‚Üí Encryption ‚Üí Disable Biometric Unlock
```

Your password will still work to unlock encryption.

## üìé Encrypted File Attachments

### What is it?
Upload files (images, PDFs, documents) to your notes with automatic client-side encryption. Files are encrypted before upload and can only be decrypted by you.

### Supported File Types

- **Images**: JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG
- **Documents**: PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT, MD
- **Spreadsheets**: XLS, XLSX, CSV
- **Presentations**: PPT, PPTX
- **Archives**: ZIP, RAR, 7Z
- **Any other file type** (up to 100 MB)

### How it Works

1. **Upload**
   - Open a note with encryption enabled and unlocked
   - Click the "Upload File" button
   - Select your file
   - File is encrypted on your device using AES-256-GCM
   - Encrypted file is uploaded to Firebase Storage
   - Metadata stored in your note

2. **View/Download**
   - Encrypted file is downloaded from storage
   - Decrypted on your device using your encryption key
   - Original file is restored and opened/downloaded

3. **Share**
   - Encrypted files can only be accessed with your encryption key
   - If you share a note, recipients need your encryption key to decrypt files

### Security Features

- **Client-Side Encryption**: Files never uploaded in plaintext
- **AES-256-GCM**: Military-grade encryption
- **Unique IV**: Each file has its own initialization vector
- **Encrypted Metadata**: File names and types are also encrypted
- **Zero-Knowledge**: Server cannot read your files
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypted files stored in Firebase Storage

### Usage

**In Note Editor:**
```tsx
import EncryptedFileUpload from '@/components/editor/EncryptedFileUpload';

<EncryptedFileUpload 
  noteId={note.id}
  onFileUploaded={(url, metadata) => {
    // Add file to note
  }}
  maxSize={100 * 1024 * 1024} // 100 MB
/>
```

**Upload Files:**
1. Ensure encryption is unlocked
2. Click file upload button in editor
3. Select file
4. File automatically encrypts and uploads
5. Progress bar shows encryption + upload status

**Download Files:**
1. Click on attached file in note
2. File automatically downloads and decrypts
3. Original file opens in browser or downloads

### File Size Limits

- **Default**: 100 MB per file
- **Large Files**: Chunked encryption for files > 10 MB
- **Storage**: Depends on your Firebase plan
  - Free: 5 GB total storage
  - Blaze (Pay-as-you-go): Unlimited (you pay for storage)

### Metadata Structure

```typescript
interface FileAttachment {
  id: string;              // Unique file ID
  name: string;            // Original filename
  url: string;             // URL to encrypted file
  mimeType: string;        // Original MIME type
  size: number;            // Original file size (bytes)
  encryptedSize: number;   // Encrypted file size (bytes)
  encrypted: boolean;      // Always true for encrypted files
  iv: number[];            // Initialization vector for decryption
  uploadedAt: Date;        // Upload timestamp
}
```

### API Usage

**Encrypt File:**
```typescript
import { encryptFile } from '@/lib/crypto/file-encryption';

const file = // File from input
const encryptionKey = // Your CryptoKey

const { encryptedData, metadata } = await encryptFile(file, encryptionKey);
```

**Decrypt File:**
```typescript
import { decryptFile } from '@/lib/crypto/file-encryption';

const encryptedBlob = // Blob from storage
const metadata = // Stored metadata
const encryptionKey = // Your CryptoKey

const originalFile = await decryptFile(encryptedBlob, metadata, encryptionKey);
```

**Bulk Operations:**
```typescript
// Encrypt multiple files
const encryptedFiles = await encryptFiles(files, encryptionKey, (current, total) => {
  console.log(`Encrypted ${current}/${total}`);
});

// Decrypt multiple files
const decryptedFiles = await decryptFiles(encryptedFiles, encryptionKey);
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Biometric Security

‚úÖ **Pros:**
- Convenient and fast
- More secure than weak passwords
- Device-specific (can't be remotely compromised)
- Biometric data never leaves device

‚ö†Ô∏è **Cons:**
- Device-specific (need to set up on each device)
- Depends on device security
- Can't use on devices without biometric

**Best Practices:**
- Use strong encryption password as backup
- Keep recovery key safe
- Don't share device with others
- Use device lock screen

### File Encryption Security

‚úÖ **Pros:**
- Client-side encryption (zero-knowledge)
- AES-256-GCM (military-grade)
- Unique IV per file
- Encrypted file names

‚ö†Ô∏è **Cons:**
- File size increases ~16 bytes (GCM tag + IV)
- Requires encryption key to access
- Cannot recover if key is lost

**Best Practices:**
- Don't upload sensitive files on public networks without VPN
- Back up your encryption key/recovery key
- Use strong encryption password
- Be aware of file size limits

## üö® Important Notes

### Biometric Unlock

1. **Device-Specific**
   - Set up biometric on each device separately
   - Mobile app, desktop browser, etc. all need separate setup

2. **Browser Support**
   - Requires modern browser with WebAuthn support
   - Some browsers may not support all biometric types

3. **Password Backup**
   - Always keep your password safe
   - Biometric is convenience, not a replacement

### Encrypted Files

1. **Storage Costs**
   - Encrypted files count toward Firebase storage quota
   - Monitor your usage on Firebase Console

2. **Performance**
   - Large files take longer to encrypt/decrypt
   - Use Wi-Fi for large file uploads

3. **Compatibility**
   - Encrypted files can only be opened with encryption key
   - Sharing encrypted notes requires sharing encryption key
