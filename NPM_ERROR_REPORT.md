## ✅ Fix Strategy

### Step 1: Fix React Version Conflict

**Downgrade to React 18.x** (stable, widely supported)

```json
{
  "react": "^18.2.0",
  "react-dom": "^18.2.0"
}
```

**Also update**:
```json
{
  "@types/react": "^18.2.0",
  "@types/react-dom": "^18.2.0"
}
```

### Step 2: Fix Security Vulnerabilities

## 🔧 Why React 19 is Problematic

React 19 is **experimental/bleeding-edge**:
- Released very recently
- Many libraries don't support it yet
- Not recommended for production
- Peer dependency issues common

React 18 is **stable and recommended**:
- Widely supported
- All major libraries compatible
- Production-ready
- Better ecosystem support

---

## 🎯 Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Critical)
1. ✅ Downgrade React to 18.x
2. ✅ Update TypeScript types
3. ✅ Run npm install
4. ✅ Verify build works

### Follow-up (Important)
1. ⚠️ Run npm audit fix
2. ⚠️ Update vulnerable packages
3. ⚠️ Test all features
4. ⚠️ Update documentation

---

## 📦 Updated package.json

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    // ... other dependencies unchanged
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/react": "^18.2.0",
    "@types/react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    // ... other dev dependencies unchanged
  }
}
```

---

## 🚀 Post-Fix Verification

After applying fixes, verify:

```bash
# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Check for errors
npm audit

# Build project
npm run build

# Run dev server
npm run dev
```

All should succeed without errors.
