## 🔐 End-to-End Encryption

### Military-Grade Security for Your Notes

**What is E2EE?**
End-to-end encryption means your notes are encrypted on your device BEFORE being sent to the cloud. Only you can decrypt them. Not even we (the developers) can read your notes.

### **Key Features:**

#### 🛡️ **AES-256-GCM Encryption**
- Military-grade encryption algorithm
- Same standard used by governments and banks
- Impossible to crack with current technology

#### 🔑 **Password-Based Key Derivation**
- PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- Unique salt per user
- Password never stored, only verified

#### 🚫 **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**
- Encryption happens client-side only
- Server only stores encrypted blobs
- We cannot access your notes
- Truly private

#### 💾 **What Gets Encrypted:**
- ✅ Note content (text, formatting)
- ✅ Diagram data (flowcharts, mindmaps, etc.)
- ✅ AI API keys (double-encrypted)
- ❌ Note titles (for search/navigation)
- ❌ Metadata (dates, types, folder structure)

### **How to Enable:**

1. **During Signup** (Recommended):
   - Complete registration
   - Encryption setup wizard appears
   - Create encryption password
   - Save recovery key

2. **After Signup**:
   - Go to Settings → Encryption
   - Click "Enable End-to-End Encryption"
   - Follow setup wizard

### **Setup Process:**

#### Step 1: Choose Password
- Create strong encryption password
- Separate from login password
- Minimum 8 characters
- Remember it - cannot be reset!

#### Step 2: Save Recovery Key
- 64-character recovery key generated
- **CRITICAL**: Save this securely!
- Only way to recover if you forget password
- Store in password manager or safe location

#### Step 3: Encrypt Existing Notes
- Optionally encrypt already-created notes
- One-click migration
- Irreversible process

### **Using Encryption:**

#### Unlocking
After login with encryption enabled:
1. Encryption unlock screen appears
2. Enter your encryption password
3. Notes decrypted and available
4. Key stored in memory (session only)

#### Locking
When stepping away:
1. Go to Settings → Encryption
2. Click "Lock Encryption"
3. Notes become inaccessible
4. Unlock again when needed

### **Recovery Options:**

#### If You Forget Password:
1. Use your 64-character recovery key
2. Enter recovery key at login
3. Set new encryption password
4. Continue using notes

#### If You Lose Recovery Key:
- **Notes are PERMANENTLY UNRECOVERABLE**
- This is by design (zero-knowledge)
- Start fresh with new notes

### **Security Specifications:**

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Algorithm | AES-256-GCM |
| Key Size | 256 bits |
| IV Size | 96 bits (12 bytes) |
| Key Derivation | PBKDF2 |
| Iterations | 100,000 |
| Hash | SHA-256 |

### **Threat Protection:**

✅ **Protected Against:**
- Server breaches
- Database leaks
- Man-in-the-middle attacks
- Malicious administrators
- Government requests (we can't decrypt)

⚠️ **NOT Protected Against:**
- Keyloggers on your device
- Compromised browser/OS
- Physical access to unlocked device
- Weak passwords

### **Best Practices:**

1. 📝 Use a strong, unique password
2. 💾 Store recovery key safely
3. 🔄 Keep multiple backup copies
4. 🔒 Lock when stepping away
5. 🚫 Never share password or recovery key
6. 💻 Use trusted devices only
