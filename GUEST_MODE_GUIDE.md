## 💾 How Guest Storage Works

### Local Storage

**Guest notes are stored in browser's localStorage:**

```typescript
// Storage key
localStorage.cogninote_guest_notes = [
  {
    id: "guest-note-1-1234567890",
    title: "My First Note",
    content: {...},
    createdAt: "2025-10-11T10:00:00Z",
    updatedAt: "2025-10-11T10:05:00Z"
  },
  // ... more notes
]
```

**Features:**
- ✅ Persists across browser sessions
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ No server required
- ✅ Full note structure
- ❌ Not synced across devices
- ❌ Cleared if browser cache cleared

### Migration

When user creates account:

```typescript
1. User signs up
2. System detects guest notes
3. Automatically uploads all notes to backend
4. Clears local storage
5. User continues with cloud storage
```

**Seamless transition!** No work lost.
