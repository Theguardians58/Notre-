# üöÄ Push to Your Repository

## Push CogniNote to https://github.com/Theguardians58/Notre-

Since we can't push directly from this environment, follow these steps on your local machine:

---

## üì• Option 1: Clone This Workspace (Recommended)

### Step 1: Download the Workspace

If you're using Cursor or have access to this workspace locally:

```bash
# Navigate to your workspace directory (it's already at /workspace)
cd /workspace

# Verify files are ready
git status
git log --oneline -1
```

### Step 2: Add Your Repository and Push

```bash
# The remote is already added, just push
git push -u origin main

# If that doesn't work, try with your credentials:
git push https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME:YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN@github.com/Theguardians58/Notre-.git main
```

## üì¶ Option 2: Download and Re-upload

If you can't access the workspace directly:

### Step 1: Download Files

1. Download all files from the workspace
2. Or clone this repository if it's available elsewhere

### Step 2: Create Fresh Local Repo

```bash
# Create a new directory
mkdir cogninote
cd cogninote

# Copy all workspace files here
# (copy from /workspace or your download location)

# Initialize git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: CogniNote v2.1.0"
```

### Step 3: Push to Your Repo

```bash
# Add your remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/Theguardians58/Notre-.git

# Rename branch to main
git branch -M main

# Push (you'll be prompted for username/password or token)
git push -u origin main

# If the repo already has content, use force push:
git push -u origin main --force
```
