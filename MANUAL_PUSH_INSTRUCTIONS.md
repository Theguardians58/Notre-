# üì§ Manual Push Instructions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Token Authentication Failed

The automatic push didn't work. Here's how to complete it manually.

---

## üîç Possible Issues

1. **Token Expired**: The token may have expired
2. **Wrong Permissions**: Token needs `repo` scope
3. **Repository Name**: Verify the repo is actually named "Notre-" (with the dash)

---

## ‚úÖ **Solution: Push from Your Computer**

### Method 1: If You Have Cursor/This Workspace Locally

If you're working in Cursor and this is your local workspace:

1. **Open Terminal in Cursor**
2. **Run these commands**:
   ```bash
   cd /workspace
   git push origin main
   ```
3. **When prompted for credentials**:
   - Username: `Theguardians58`
   - Password: [Generate a NEW token - see below]

---

### Method 2: Create a New Token

Your current token may be invalid. Create a fresh one:

1. **Go to**: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
2. **Settings**:
   - Note: `CogniNote Repository Access`
   - Expiration: `90 days` (or your preference)
   - Scopes: ‚òëÔ∏è **repo** (select ALL repo permissions)
3. **Click**: "Generate token"
4. **Copy the token** (starts with `ghp_...`)

5. **Push with new token**:
   ```bash
   cd /workspace
   git push https://Theguardians58:YOUR_NEW_TOKEN@github.com/Theguardians58/Notre-.git main --force
   ```

---

### Method 3: Verify Repository Name

The repository name "Notre-" (with trailing dash) is unusual. Verify:

1. Go to: https://github.com/Theguardians58
2. Check your repository list
3. Find the actual repository name
4. Update the remote:
   ```bash
   cd /workspace
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Theguardians58/ACTUAL_REPO_NAME.git
   git push origin main
   ```

---

### Method 4: Use GitHub Desktop (Easiest for Non-Technical)

1. **Download**: https://desktop.github.com/
2. **Install and login** to GitHub Desktop
3. **File ‚Üí Add Local Repository**
4. **Browse** to `/workspace`
5. **Publish Repository**
6. **Choose**:
   - Name: `Notre-` or your preferred name
   - Keep code private: ‚òëÔ∏è (if you want)
7. **Click Publish**

Done! üéâ

---

### Method 5: Download and Re-upload

If you can't access the workspace:

1. **Create a ZIP of these files** (or ask me to list them)
2. **Create a new repository** on GitHub
3. **Upload files** via GitHub web interface:
   - Go to your repo
   - Click "uploading an existing file"
   - Drag all files
   - Commit

---

## üîß Create New Repository (If Needed)

If "Notre-" doesn't exist or you want a fresh start:

1. **Go to**: https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name**: `cogninote` (or `Notre-` if you prefer)
3. **Description**: `AI-Powered Note-Taking with Diagrams and E2E Encryption`
4. **Private or Public**: Your choice
5. **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README"
6. **Click**: "Create repository"

Then push:
```bash
cd /workspace
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Theguardians58/NEW_REPO_NAME.git
git push -u origin main
```
